# Kool

Kool is an open source platform for online classroom management. 

## Code Example

TBD - Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Currently, teachers who manage online classes use several tools with different purposes. For example, they can use one application for distributing content (mailing lists, custom websites), one application for quizzes and homework submission, one application to manage gradebooks, another for classroom discussion (forums, webconferencing or chat), and several others. Our aim is to consolidate the necessary functionality into one standalone solution while keeping it lightweight, easy to deploy & use, and also make it easy to add new functionality.

## Installation

TBD - Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

TBD - Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

TBD - Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
